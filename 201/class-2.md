# what i have learned in class-02 :

**summary:**

today in the lab  we creat a small webpage using HTML , CSS and JS .
we asked the user 4 questions using **prompt** , and used **alert** to 
show a message to him  .

## HTML :

- 2 types of markup :

**structural markup*

      some tags used to make the page easier to read and to interact with .
    * h1....h6 :heading tags
    * p : paragraph tag
    * sup :super script tag 
    * sub : subscript 


**semantic markup*

     these tags used just for orqanizing the page 
   * strong : it has the same effect of bold tag
   * em : make the text italic
   * blockquote : long quotes 
   * q : shorter quotes 

   ## CSS

   as you know CSS used to decorate the webpage and make it attractive , **so how we do that?**
   first of all you should know that there is :

   * BLOCK ELEMENTS :

   looke like they start new lines 

   * INLINE ELEMENTS :

    don't start new line they just  flow within the text


    ## what CSS include :

    1- selector : specify the elements the rule applies to

    2- declaration : indicate what these elements should look like

    ## how to import my CSS file to HTML file :

    - you can insert link tage in the head tag .

    - another way is to write the css code inside the HTML file using style tag


## JS :

as you know this is a interactive language .

js code contain a  series of lines each line is call statment and we sepert between statmants with semicolon
to make the code more understandabale we add comments .

**VAR**
  variable is like a container for values you can put inside it numbers , string  and 
  boolean 

  **rules to name var.*

  1- it must start with letter , $ or _

  2-You cannot use keywords or reserved 

  3- the var is a case sensitive 

  4- use capital letter in the begining of each word if your var contain many words .


### there is a special type of var called ARRAY  **It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.** 

in JS we have also 
  
  - EXPRESSIONS
  
  - OPERATORS 

  - ARITHMETI C OPERATORS 

  - STRING OPERATOR


  ## loops in JS : 

  first we should know what are the oreratores used in JS : 

  =

  >

  <

  =!

  ==

  ===

  >=

  <=

  and

  or 

  ||


  **IF statment:**

  

  **IF- ELSE STATMENT**
