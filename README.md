## growth mindset :

i think it's a way to make our thinking process much useful and much practical so we can find solutions to our problems .


## how to keep yourself in a growth mindset :

1- you should have a clear goal .

2- i believe sometimes we have to compare ourselves with others and if we did this our mind or brain will grow and work better 

3-do not listen to negative people .
