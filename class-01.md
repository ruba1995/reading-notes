# introduction :

 **the first thing that we all should know ; that creating a website and reading a code is not  that hard to learn  a it seems to be .**

 * now we will focus on : 

 - HTML : we will learn how to use it to creat the foundations of a webpage .

 - CSS : it used to style the page , mainly it's properities fall into one of two categories 
      * presentation : how to control things like color , font size ...
      * layout : how to control where to put different  elements on screen .

- WebServers : it's a special computer host the website .

- Devices : phone , laptop , tablets ...

- Screen Readers .

## HOW WEBSITE WORKS ?
 
 **1- what you see ?**

 at first look what you see is HTML and CSS code sent from server to your brower.

 **2- how it is created ?**

 HTML and CSS are used to build small websites , but if you want to build a large website with database and more feature you need to lean many languages like PHP , SQL ,AP.NET ...

 **3- HTML5 & CSS3**

 the newest versitions of HTML and CSS 

## HOW THE WEB WORKS ?

 the browser will connect to domain name system (DNS)server to find the location of web server .

 ## HTML :

 stand for **HyperTextMarkupLanguage** ,it's structural language used to build the foundation of a website , now each HTML page has 3 main tages 

 -html tage : closing and opening tages 

 -head tage : closing and opening tages (contain some tages like title tage )

 -body tage : closing and opening tages  (contain most of html tages)

 * now what are tages : 

 it's specific words have a certain job in the code .

 some tages in HTML have closing tages and some of them haven't .

 **we can write commint in our code using this tag <!....   .....>**

 **HTML5:**

 as we said befor it's the newest version of html ,it  introduca new set of
elements that help define the structure of a page.
now if we want older browser to understand it we need mor JS .

**lt's talk about designing :**

when we are talking about designing we have to take care about audience ,and wht they should understand and feel when they see the website for the first time 
 
## ABC of programming :

scripting : a series of instructions that the computer
